# CleanDataProject
This repository contains data files, R code and output of processing for the Course Project of Getting and Cleaning Data Data Science Class offered at coursera.com.

### Project Overview

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data used here was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The R script included in this repository processes the data files and produces and smaller, cleaner data sets.

### Files

- <b>run_analysis.R</b> contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

- <b>codebook.md</b> outlines variables and processes used in the R script.

- <b>averages.txt</b> is the output of run_analysis.R.
